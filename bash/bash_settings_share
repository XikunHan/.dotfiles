# ----- READLINE FUNCTION KEY BINDINGS -----
# useful functions and short cuts on the command line
# see all available Readline functions with command: bind -l
# see current key bindings: bind -P

# make cursor jump over words
bind '"\e[5C": forward-word'	# control+arrow_right
bind '"\e[5D": backward-word'	# control+arrow_left

# change beginning-of-line key binding b/c it interferes w screen command
# bind '"\C-f": beginning-of-line'        # control-a is used by screens, so use control-f to jump to beginning of line (and unbind it from forward character, which is pretty useless)
# this was my original thought but changing the escape char in screen is more comfortable. FYI, C-f and C-b are ripe for re-binding because forward-character backward-character are useless

# make history searchable by entering the beginning of command and using up and down keys
bind '"\e[A": history-search-backward'	# control+arrow_up
bind '"\e[B": history-search-forward'	# control+arrow_down

# see all readline functions and what their bey bindings are
bind '"\ea": dump-functions'	# ESC+a
